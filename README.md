# Weather Journal App
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

## How it works

1. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specific location based on its latitude and longitude.
2. Users can enter their zip code and how they are feeling in the provided input fields.
3. When the "Generate" button is clicked, the app makes a POST request to the server with the weather data and user input.
4. The server stores the data in a `projectData` object and sends a success message back to the client.
5. The app then updates the UI with the retrieved data from the server.

## Techniques That Use

- Node.js
- Express.js
